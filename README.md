## Features

- Merge duplicate performers whilst selecting which data you want to keep from each.
- Merge lists of aliases, URLs, and tags with a single click.
- A familiar UI based on the Stash scraper dialog.
- Localization support where possible\*
- _Coming soon_ - support for merging studios

\* Where possible, Stash Mergers references the localization file for the user's selected language in Stash. In some places, e.g. some warning messages, localization options aren't available so are hardcoded in English.

## Installation

1. In Stash go to Settings > Plugins.
2. Under _Available Plugins_ click the Add Source button.
3. Fill out the fields in the popup form. The Name and Local Path fields can be whatever you like, but the Source URL needs to match the URL below. I recommend the following;
   - Name: Valkyr-JS
   - Source URL: https://valkyr-js.github.io/stash-plugins/index.yml
   - Local Path: Valkyr-JS
4. Click confirm and you should see a new line under _Available Plugins_ called "Valkyr-JS" (or whatever you entered for Name in the popup). Click this and you'll see my available plugins.
5. Check the _Stash Mergers_ checkbox and click Install to the top right of _Avaialable Plugins_.
6. Go to a performer's profile page and you should see the Merge button next to the red Delete button. You may need to refresh the page to see the changes.
